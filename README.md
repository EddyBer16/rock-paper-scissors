# Rock Paper Scissors

# How does the script work?

1. Get computer selection
		
		Using Math.random get a number from 0 to 2 and get a random index from selections array

2. Get player selection
		
		Using prompt() get player's selection [rock, paper, scissors] and transform it to lower case
	
3. Get winning player using player's selection
		
		Note: I used numbers for defining the player who has won

		E.g.: playRound returns 1, player 1 (user) has won

4. Show if player has won or lost and the result of both selections

5. Repeat all steps 5 times
